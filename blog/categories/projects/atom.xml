    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s been a year, completing my first project on freelancer.com and receiving a 5 star feedback.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>In retrospect, it seems like it all happened so quickly.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>Remember the first feedback I received, that positive feedback had a great impact on my freelancing career.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/thanks-nit3hawkz-review.jpg" title="Mr. Nit3hawkz Review" alt="Mr. Nit3hawkz Review" /></p>

<p>After that I was able to complete a series of freelancing projects. At the same time I learned a great deal of new things about web design and development.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;How far that little candle throws his beams! So shines a good deed in a weary world.&rdquo; &ndash; William Shakespeare</p></blockquote></p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/nit3hawkz-profile.jpg" title="Mr. Nit3hawkz Profile" alt="Mr. Nit3hawkz Profile" /></p>

<p>Thank you Mr. Nit3hawkz for helping me to start my career in freelancing. I completed three projects for Mr. Nit3hawkz in the past year.</p>

<p>First Project &ndash; <a href="/blog/coming-soon-site/" >Exp Tennis Project</a><br />
Second Project &ndash; <a href="/blog/facebook-app-sweepstakes/" >Facebook App Project</a><br />
Third Project &ndash; <a href="/blog/language-parlor-project/" >Language Parlor Project</a><br /></p>

<p><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Unselfish and noble actions are the most radiant pages in the biography of souls.&rdquo; &ndash; David Thomas</p></blockquote></p>

<h2>Dear Other Employers,</h2>


<p>I thank all of you.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>I can&rsquo;t win, I can&rsquo;t reign<br/>I will never win this game<br/>Without you, without you<br/>I am lost, I am vain,<br/>I will never be the same<br/>Without you, without you</p></blockquote></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I only needed one dollar. If you&rsquo;ve missed that post, <a href="/blog/i-only-need-one-dollar/" >read it here</a>.</p>

<p>However, I was fortunate enough to receive a dollar. In fact, I received 10 USD. Mr. Cstoudt released 10 previously milestoned dollars.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/how-i-earned-one-dollar.jpg" title="How I earned one dollar" alt="How I earned one dollar" /></p>

<h2>An Unreleased Milestone</h2>


<p>Do you remember once I completed a project for Mr. Cstoudt? (See: <a href="/blog/wordpress-toolbar-customization/" >WordPress Toolbar Customization</a>) Eventhough I completed that project successfully, there remained an unreleased and fogotten milestone. While I was thinking how to find the missing dollar yesterday, while I was browsing through my freelancer.com financial dashboard, I noticed this milestone. I contacted Mr. Cstoudt and asked him to release the milestone.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/requesting-to-release-the-milestone.jpg" title="Requesting to release the milestone" alt="Requesting to release the milestone" /></p>

<p>I received this about 8:10 on 1st July, 2013. This is a new month. I was finding a dollar in the previous month. However I decided this payment should be counted as received in the previous month. I live in Sri Lanka (+5.30UTC). Client sent the payment from USA (-6.00UTC). For Mr. Cstoudt it was only 20:40 on 30th June, 2013. See the below illustration.</p>

<h2>Finally, I collected the missing dollar</h2>


<p>Just before the end of the month (somewhere +X.YYUTC), I was able to withdraw money from my freelancer.com account. Thanks Mr. Cstout (10 USD) and Mr. Brant (30 USD).</p>

    <id>http://uw-freelancer.github.io/blog/two-website-customizations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Two websites had to be customized when I was contacted for this project. I was contacted by Mr. Brant about this improvement. A freelancer.com project was created to make payments and exchange feedback.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/website-customization-project-specification.jpg" title="Website Customization Project Description" alt="Website Customization Project Description" /></p>

<p>First one of two projects was described on oDesk. A child theme (called &lsquo;Curb Appeal&rsquo;) based on popular Genesis Framework needed to be customized.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/genesis-framework-customization.jpg" title="Genesis Framework Customization" alt="Genesis Framework Customization" /></p>

<p>In &lsquo;Curb Appeal&rsquo; theme there was only one section in home top area.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>&lsquo;Initial Code &ndash; functions.php&rsquo; </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='php'><span class='line'><span class="x">&amp;lt;?php</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">genesis_register_sidebar( array(&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#39;id&#39;            =&amp;gt; &#39;home-top&#39;,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&#39;name&#39;          =&amp;gt; &#39;Home Top&#39;,</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&#39;description&#39;   =&amp;gt; &#39;This is the Home Top section&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;) );</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">?&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>I replaced it with two sidebars as follows.</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>&lsquo;Code After Modification &ndash; functions.php&rsquo; </span></figcaption>

</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;) );</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="x">&lt;p&gt;) );</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="x">?&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>Next project was about adding a &lsquo;Banner&rsquo; for category archive pages. The following is the category banner uploader I developed.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/wordpress-category-banner.jpg" title="Category Banner Uploader" alt="Category Banner Uploader" /></p>

<p>I was able to successfully complete the project and earned $25USD (freelancer.com charges only 10% of the total amount. But the lowest possible is $5USD).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The project poster (Mr. Cstoudt) wanted to add custom menu to their WordPress Admin Bar.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The correct term is ToolBar (not Admin Bar). The Toolbar was added in Version 3.1 as Admin Bar and in Version 3.3 it was replaced by the Toolbar.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The following is an screenshot of the project description posted on freelancer.com.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/wordpress-toolbar-customization-description.jpg" title="WordPress Toolbar Customization Description" alt="WordPress Toolbar Customization Description" /></p>

<p>I decided to implement administration functions of the menu with WordPress native menu editor. E.g. One can add/edit menu items as though it is an ordinary WordPress menu. But this menu will be displayed on WordPress Toolbar.</p>

<h2>A Hidden Challenge</h2>


<p>A challenge was hidden in this project. Menu items were dependent of the membership level being visited. i.e. different menu needs to be displayed for different membership levels. Membership management was done by another plugin. I was able to successfully satisfy these requirements too.</p>

<p>I was able to hook into the proper point of WordPress execution and inject the new menu to WordPress Toolbar. I was able to complete the project successfully.</p>

<p>The following is the review by cstoudt for the correct interpretation and implementation of his needs for this project.</p>
