    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A PHP GD extensive WordPress Plugin for Dynamic ID Card Generation with c128b Bars and Spaces Encoded Strings having a Cart Communicating to PayPal via REST(beta) API.</p>

<h2>Mr. Archieh and His ID Card Project</h2>


<p>The project was posted by Mr. Archieh on freelancer.com. I was among another 26 bidders with an average of 558USD budget. I knew, I could do this. I bidded with 388USD.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/idcards/project-description.png" title="Project Description" alt="Project Description" /></p>

<h2>Extensive use of the PHP GD Extension</h2>


<p>A set of PHP GD image manupulation functions were at the core of this plugin serving the purpose of generating dynamic ID cards that were ready to be printed. Creating image resources from uploaded files. Adding text on top of the image. Even overlaying transparent image on top of the background was done. The project was about living inside <b>the wonderful world of PHP GD image manupulation</b>.</p>

<h2>RESTful PayPal Beta</h2>


<p><img class='center' src="/images/idcards/restful-paypal-beta.png" title="RESTful PayPal Beta" alt="RESTful PayPal Beta" /></p>

<p><blockquote><p>The PayPal API uses HTTP verbs and a RESTful endpoint structure. OAuth 2.0 is used as the API Authorization framework. Request and response payloads are formatted as JSON.</p></p><p><ul><br/><li>PayPal REST API Reference</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>


<p>With OAuth 2.0 authorization is easy. All you need to do is present your client credentials and obtain a bearer token. No signing of requests is needed as with earlier OAuth.</p>

<h2>C128b Encoded Data</h2>


<p>Visitors should be given a facility to enter a string of their choice and it should be immediately converted to a Barcode (c128b).</p>

    <id>http://uw-freelancer.github.io/blog/wordpress-pages-creation-plugin</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This project is different from other freelance projects in many ways. First I failed. Then I was promoted to level 16. Again I succeeded. Next I was paid. Finally I was recognized as a good service provider.</p>

<h2> Level 16 @ Freelancer.com [Novice]</h2>


<p>I was able to reach the Level 16 at Freelancer.com with the completion of this project.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/level16-novice.jpg" title="Level 16 Novice" alt="Level 16 Novice" /></p>

<h2>A Failed Project</h2>


<p>I wasn&rsquo;t able to delivery what I promised initially. The result was a bad review from the employer.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/communication-failure.jpg" title="Communication Failure" alt="Communication Failure" /></p>

<p>I deserve that review. I failed to deliver what he initially demanded to do. I thought I would be able to complete the project. But Pinterest made it hard to connect with them without a proper API. The following is the initial project description.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/wordpress-plugin-post-to-pinterest.jpg" title="WordPress Plugin Post to Pinterest" alt="WordPress Plugin Post to Pinterest" /></p>

<p>See the above review: <b>On Time: No</b></p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve tried many hours to get this plugin work. All attempts failed. Project went for a long time than I initially promised. However, employer assigned me the other project he had posted on freelancer.com. I knew that I could complete that project, at the first impression of the project description. I accepted the project. I delivered it very quickly.</p>

<h2>5.50USD Tip</h2>


<p>I received a tip for the successful completion of the second project.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/5usd-bonus.jpg" title="5 USD Bonus" alt="5 USD Bonus" /></p>

<h2>Recognition as a Good Service Provider</h2>


<p>Eventhough the first project failed, the second project was a success. I tried my best to deliver a good plugin for the second project. I received a comment from the employer worth of thousands of dollars.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>Thanks for the work you have done. You really do go an extra mile and that is what separates you from the a lot of people. Being a service provider always go along way. So Thanks a bunch. Have a great weekend! :&ndash;) All the best.</p></p><p><ul><br/><li>runeellingsen</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>


<p>The following are the feedbacks exchanged after the project completion.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-15T20:55:00+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://uw-freelancer.github.io/blog/wordpress-toolbar-customization</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The project poster (Mr. Cstoudt) wanted to add custom menu to their WordPress Admin Bar.</p>

<p><blockquote><p>The correct term is ToolBar (not Admin Bar). The Toolbar was added in Version 3.1 as Admin Bar and in Version 3.3 it was replaced by the Toolbar.</p></blockquote></p>

<p>The following is an screenshot of the project description posted on freelancer.com.</p>

<p><img class='center' src="/images/blog/wordpress-toolbar-customization-description.jpg" title="WordPress Toolbar Customization Description" alt="WordPress Toolbar Customization Description" /></p>

<p>I decided to implement administration functions of the menu with WordPress native menu editor. E.g. One can add/edit menu items as though it is an ordinary WordPress menu. But this menu will be displayed on WordPress Toolbar.</p>

<h2>A Hidden Challenge</h2>


<p>A challenge was hidden in this project. Menu items were dependent of the membership level being visited. i.e. different menu needs to be displayed for different membership levels. Membership management was done by another plugin. I was able to successfully satisfy these requirements too.</p>

<p>I was able to hook into the proper point of WordPress execution and inject the new menu to WordPress Toolbar. I was able to complete the project successfully.</p>

<p>The following is the review by cstoudt for the correct interpretation and implementation of his needs for this project.</p>
